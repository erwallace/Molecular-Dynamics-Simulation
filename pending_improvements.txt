CODE IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------
- reformat top_level.py so that it can be run start to finish (i.e. to find relaxation time and implement)
- check what duration is needed for vcf cumulative integral to converge (is 3 x relaxation time enough?)
- how do I determine an appropriate equilibration period?
- add animation feature
- write set of code to calculate/plot msd
- add logger library instead of printing everything
- add in unit tests for completeness
- return all plots/csv/txt files to an output folder

FORMATTING FOR GITHUB
---------------------
- add requirements.txt
- convert parameters function to dictionary or config file
- move md.py into src (source) directory
- expand README.md to include running instructions, background, and stylistic choices (e.g. what formatted did you use)
- research and implement os library (vsc f5 will give different ways of running a file)

N.B. on my laptop, a simulation with 172 particles for 1 second took 130 seconds. I recommend performing a similar calculation
on your own system so that you can approximate how long a given simulation will take. MD simulations scale linearly with time
and quadratically with the number of particles.
